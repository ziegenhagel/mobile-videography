# Besseres Filmen

## Edit in mind
How am I gonna cut those?

## Each shot has its own Story

## Framing
Everything that u put in the frame says something.
### Balance
### Complicated cuz infinite possibilities.
### (Hilfestellungen like rule of thirds)
### Centred forces us to look at it, thirds helps look beyond
### Side objects invites to look into frame
### Film into edges

Bcauz small camera => Camera movement / Gimbal
Get closer rather than zoomin in, also for depth of field
Slo-mo pushing in and out
## Depth
